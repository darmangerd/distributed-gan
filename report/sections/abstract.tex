\chapter{Abstract}
With the rise of deep learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a popular method for generating synthetic data. However, training GANs is challenging, particularly when dealing with large and privacy-sensitive datasets. This work provides an extensive analysis of training GANs in a distributed setting, presenting an open-source implementation that operates over networked environments while enhancing privacy by keeping data local. This research was developed for the "Distributed Deep Learning" course at the University of Neuch√¢tel.
